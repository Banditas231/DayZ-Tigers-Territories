Hello everyone.
This time I present tiger territories.xml for Chernarus map. Mod:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2701026668
Mod comes with .xml but not what I like, so I spended some time, and created .xml to fit them to the game.
Both tigers spawn in forestry areas.
Instaliation:
Just follow --> mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\env and add tiger_territories.xml in (env folder)
Also do not forget add types. Thats it now go and hunt the tigers.
If you wanna you can check it on my server:
